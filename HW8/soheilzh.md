# CLARITY
1. Title, axis labels are too small. The font should be enlarged.
2. Number of bike rides is much smaller than subway rides, therefore one cannot simply put them on the same plot. You should use log-scale for that purpose.
3. I would suggest increasing number of ticks, it's hard to read the plot with just 3 ticks on the y-axis.

# ESTHETIC
1. I would suggest changing the colors from red to green or something less alarming. 
2. Adding background color to the png image would help reading the labels and title.

# HONESTY
1. The plot seems to be honest. But it does not illustrate anything. The number of bike rides is too small to compare to the subway rides.
