# CLARITY
1. Title, axis labels are too small. The font should be enlarged.
2. There is no label on the y-axis. What is it? Count, dollars, pounds?

# ESTHETIC
1. Data range on the y-axis might be increased by 1 tic in both directions.
2. The data on the x-axis is hard to read. I would suggest rotating it for 45 degrees, or 90 degrees with degreesing the number of ticks.

# HONESTY
1. The plot doesn't seem to be honest. On the top graph it seems to be cutting off the range from 0 to 5200, increasing the value of the smaller changes so they appear like an increase of +200%, while in reality the spikes are no higher than +20%.
