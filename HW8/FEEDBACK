YOUR PLOT

=========

missing x label

y label too small

size of points is unexplained

the large number of points causes crowdedness and ibstruction. consider contour plots instead where the density of points is too high



notes on plots you reviewed
============================

soheilzh
=========

a meaningful comparison is impossible due to the large difference in the men values. if that was the point then a time series would be unnecessary. if the structure should have been compared then a time series should have been modified by multiplying by an appropriate constant and indicating that in the legend 

small axes labels

the axis labels should be words, not variable names: startdate -> "start date (startdate)"

JzyJade
========

missing y axis labels entirely

dots and lines are redundant consider histogram steps then for visualizing time series with the dot at the center of the step

otherwise it is a simple clean viz

Jihenghuang
=============
unmotivated empty space to the right

the choice of red single color is "aggressive" to the sight, which may or may not be the desired effect given context. but it is a color that does not comply well with color blindness, so if that is the desired effect it would be lost in 10% of the male population

axis labels a bit small
